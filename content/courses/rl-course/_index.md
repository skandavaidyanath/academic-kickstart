First couple of posts in the series are out! Third post will be out soon!

Hi! This is a course on reinforcement learning (RL). RL is the third, less spoken about paradigm of machine learning along with supervised learning and unsupervised learning and is something I am very fascinated by. By the end of this course, I hope to tell you a few things about RL that'll help you gain some knowledge on the subject amd also get you as interested in it as I am. Over this course, I hope to cover several RL fundamentals and algorithms. I will also try and include some code samples and implementational details wherever I see fit but I would like to keep this course mostly intuitional and theoretical. If you're looking for a course that'll just teach you how to implement RL algorithms in Python, this may not be the right one.

We'll start off with a couple of introduction posts and then cover several common RL algorithms and deep RL algorithms as well. Once again, I will try and put in code samples (Python3 and PyTorch) and mathematical proofs whenever possible.

I will add additional references if any, at the end of each lecture but most of the content for this course comes from [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Sutton and Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) (from this point will be referred to as "the RL book") and this [NPTEL course](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106106143/) by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/).

I highly recommend some background in probability and maybe even some machine learning (supervised and unsupervised learning) and optimization before you get started with this course (not a lot, but some basics would be nice). A basic understanding of neural networks and backpropagation would be useful for the deep RL posts. None of this is absolutely essential to get an intuitive idea of RL but would be useful to have a thorough understanding. 

When I learned about RL, I had to scour through the internet and read from several different sources. The point of this course is also in some way to make sure that this has all the information one should need to get started in the world of RL, especially the intuitional and mathematical details. 

This is the first time I'm doing something like this so please let me know if there's anything different you'd like to see or if I've made any mistakes.
