Hi! Thank you for taking the time out to take a look at my RL course. I hope to cover several RL fundamentals and algorithms as a part of this course in a little bit more theoretical detail than I normally come across. Having said that, I will also include some code samples wherever I see fit.

We'll start off with a couple of introduction posts and then cover several common RL algorithms and deep RL algorithms as well. I will try and put in code samples (Python3 and PyTorch) and mathematical proofs whenever possible. I will add a contents section with the course syllabus right here and keep editing it as I add more posts.

I will add references at the end of each lecture but most of the content for this course comes from [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Sutton and Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) and this [NPTEL course](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106106143/) by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). 

As I am currently conducting research in the field of RL, I will be giving some insights into how people use RL in their work and how they tackle RL problems. I will give detials about modeling the state space, action space and reward functions for an RL problem and other practical challenges one may face as well.

Please let me know if there's anything different you'd like to see or if I've made any mistakes.
