Coming soon...
# what is the bandit problem? how different from rl, simpler?
# applications
# stationary and non-stationary bandit problems
# types of solutions -- finding the value fn. i.e. expected payoff, easiest possible soln, easy exploration, softmax exploration, ucb1, naive pac, median elim pac
# touch up on thompson sampling, policy search, policy gradient reinforce
# contextual bandits and foray into rl
