Developed a policy to control a swarm of drones that attempts to negotiate with and save civilians from a forest fire and achieved a success rate of over 95% on the task. This project was done under the guidance of [Prof. Kallirroi Georgila](http://people.ict.usc.edu/~kgeorgila/) and [Prof. David Traum](http://ict.usc.edu/profile/david-traum/).
