Used program synthesis techniques to generate code from multi-modal user input using large language models like GPT-3. Developed a Jupyter notebook extension to generate code from user commands and I/O examples for the Pandas library in Python. This project was done under the guidance of [Dr. Sriram Rajamani](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sriram/) at Microsoft Research, India.
