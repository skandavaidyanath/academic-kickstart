<!-- One of the reasons I love reinforcement learning is that it comes very close to how people behave in the real world. And this isn't an accident. A lot of RL fundamentals are based on behavioural psychology.
Trial and error is built into human nature and people use it to various extents when they're trying to acquire new skills. For example, when you're trying to learn a new sport, its common to try a few different things before you get the hang of the game. 
But of course, just trial and error isn't enough is it? Sometimes we learn from demonstrations. Think about how you learned to drive for example. Someone probably showed you how to do it and then you copied them but also made changes on your own. This is where [apprenticeship learning and imitation learning](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/56577/apprenticeship-vs-imitation-learning-what-is-the-difference) come in. So the agent is now able to learn from expert demonstrations. Once again, this mirrors human behaviour.
What about [meta-learning or learning to learn](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2017/07/18/learning-to-learn/)? Trying to make an agent adapt to a set of tasks by learning universal skills rather than trying to learn independent tasks. For example, a human who has played tennis would kind of know the rules of table tennis and wouldn't have to start all over. So once again, mirrors human behaviour.

But what else are we missing? Are there other parts of human behaviour that we can emulate to try and create better AI? Consider the following scenario.
