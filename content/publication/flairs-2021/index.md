abstract: "In search and rescue missions, robots can potentially help save survivors faster than human emergency responders alone would. In our experimental virtual reality simulation environment we have a system which comprises a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a virtual “spokesperson”. The system and a human operator work together on locating and guiding survivors to safety away from an active wildfire encroaching on a small town. The UAVs and the spokesperson are equipped with natural language capabilities through which they can communicate with the survivors to convince them to evacuate. If they fail to do so they can ask the human operator to intervene. We use reinforcement learning to automatically learn a policy to be followed when a UAV has located survivors. The system learns the best course of action to help the survivors evacuate. We vary the distance of the fire, the level of cooperativeness of the survivors, and how busy the human operator is, and we report results in terms of percentage of survivors saved in each condition."
