I am a final year undergraduate student of computer science at [BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/). My research interests include reinforcement learning, deep learning and natural language processing. I like thinking about and working on different applications of RL in the real world - like dialogue systems, robotics and personalized learning. I'm also interested in thinking about the modeling of RL problems and I often find myself asking the question _'What are the properties of a good state space/reward function?'_. Recently, I've also found the idea of meta learning very intriguing and has made me think of the question _'Can I teach an agent that has learned to play tennis, to play badminton?'_. I find neural networks very fascinating as well and often think about how backpropagation works in different deep learning models. A lot of my work also involves NLP and IR and I am very interested in exploring the intersection of NLP/IR and RL.

**I am currently pursuing my undergraduate thesis at the [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/) under [Dr. Andrew Yates](https://andrewyates.net/) and [Dr. Paramita Mirza](https://paramitamirza.com/).**  

In the past I've had the good fortune of working closely with some amazing researchers such as [Prof. N. L. Bhanu Murthy](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/bhanumurthy/Profile), [Prof. Aruna Malapati](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/arunamalapati/Profile), [Prof. Kallirroi Georgila](http://people.ict.usc.edu/~kgeorgila/) and [Prof. David Traum](http://ict.usc.edu/profile/david-traum/).
