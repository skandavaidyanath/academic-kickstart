This project is currently in progress and a research paper is in preparation. I will attach the code, the slides and the paper once it has been published. This project was done under the guidance of [Prof. Kallirroi Georgila](http://people.ict.usc.edu/~kgeorgila/) and [Prof. David Traum](http://ict.usc.edu/profile/david-traum/).
