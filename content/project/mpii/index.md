Used deep reinforcement learning to recommend travel destinations to users based on forum posts and user reviews. Used deep reinforcement learning to improve document retrieval from a corpus via document expansion. This project was a part of my undergraduate thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics under [Dr. Andrew Yates](https://andrewyates.net/) and [Dr. Paramita Mirza](https://paramitamirza.com/).
